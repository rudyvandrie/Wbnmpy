# pyWBNM

This is my first github repository. We plan to use this for a python version of WBNM a hydrological model. 
The main aim is to change the primary loop from the original version of WBNM from Sub Area to Time Step.
That is the current versions of WBNM have always had the primary loop being the Sub Areas within which the time step loops were called. There are many advantages to having the TIMESTEP as the outer loop and the internal loop as the sub area.
